# Numerical Methods

This repository contains laboratories for the course named **Numerical Methods**, taken in my 3rd year at the _Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest_. It contains methods which are most related to the **magic of matrixes** ( _SVD_, _PCA_), and their application in **machine learning** (_linear regression_, _kernel methods_, _sparse dictionaries_). 

#### Table of contents
- *L1*: Introduction, _gaussian elimination_
- *L2*: Linear regression
- *L3*: Eigen
- *L4*: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- *L5*: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- *L6*: Sparse Dictionaries
- *L7*: Bayesian methods

Before running the code, make sure to create a virtual environment and install the _requirements_. For more information about the course, [here](https://numeric.cs.unibuc.ro/) is the link to the offical page.
